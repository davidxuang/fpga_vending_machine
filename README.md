# Vending machine on FPGA

This project is a solution to the assignment of *B0404050 Experiment of Digital System Design (数字系统课程设计)* in [School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/).

## Introductions

The goal of design is to create a system which functions like a vending machine which accepts cash and returns coins, on [Nexys 4 DDR](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/start) platform.

The repo includes following folders:

* **/doc** contains the documents of system architecture, UML and UI layout.
* **/img** contains the images for screen display and a PowerShell-based utility, [bmp2coe](https://github.com/davidxuang/bmp2coe). **Please notice that the example images of the drinks are neither created by me nor released under a free license by others.**
* **/src** contains a [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) 2017.4 project.

## Credits
